You are Mike, a peasant living in a small village in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and nothing else. You dream of getting out of your village and having an adventure. You go to your fields and begin working. You look up and see your best friend Jacob, who is a foot taller than you and built like a bear.

"Jacob! How are things going?" You say.
"It's going good. Finally got enough money to buy a horse!" Jacob smiles. "So I hear you're getting married..."
"Yeah, to Sarah. Her father is giving her to me to clear my debt." You say bitterly.
"Ah, the joys of being poor..."

A young boy runs into the fields. "Jacob! Help! Our house is on fire!"

> You go help them.
"We have to help them." You say.
You and Jacob rush to the burning house. You try to get the door open but it's locked. "Break it down!" Jacob says.

> You go find a key.
"A key!" You say. "Jacob, hold the door!"
You go looking through the house. The house is full of smoke and you can barely breathe. You spot a key in a bowl on a kitchen counter.

> You grab the key and hope it's the right one.
The key fits and you rush inside. The house is filled with smoke. You see a bedroom on the right side of the house and go in.
"Get the baby!" You yell to Jacob.
You pick up the baby crib and carry it out of the house.

> You say "Is there anyone else inside? Can you hear me?"
"Come on, let's go!" Jacob says.
You rush outside with the baby crib. You both see that the house is completely engulfed in flames. A man and a woman are crying at the sight of their house burning down.

> You go talk to them and explain that the baby is safe.
You go talk to the couple and explain that the baby is safe. The woman bursts into tears and hugs you and Jacob. "Thank you so much, thank you!" She cries.
Jacob awkwardly pats her on the back.

> You tell her you can help her build a new house.
"I can help you build a new house!" You say.
"Really?" She asks.
"Yeah! We'll get the supplies and start today!" You say.
The woman cries again but this time in happiness. Jacob smiles and nods.
When you're poor, you need to help each other. You're a team. You're a community.
You remember when Old Yen got sick, and your parents brought her soup and supplies every day until she got better. You remember when Celine got lost in the woods and it took a whole community to search for her.
The woman hands you the baby. Jacob takes the baby from you.
"Thanks again, I'll be sure to keep an eye on her." The woman says.
Next day, you ask around the villagers to come help with rebuilding. There's a lot of people who want to help. You get hard-working people like farmers, but also carpenters, masons, and even a blacksmith! Everyone wants to pitch in and help this family out.
You're working hard, when a carriage rolls up.

> You look at the carriage. It reminds you of something.
The carriage is white and made of wood. There are two bay horses pulling it. The coachman looks at you. He has a large mustache, wears a flat cap, and is very old.
"Hey sonny, do you know whose carriage is this?" The coachman asks.
"No, sir." You say.
"This is Count Grey's carriage! He owns many acres of wheat and corn. It's a very nice ride."
The Count gets out of the carriage.

> You bow before the Count.
You bow before Count Grey. He's very old, but you can tell he's a kind man.
"Hello there, young man." Count Grey says to you. "I need a boy to run messages for me. Do you want the job?"

> You explain you have promised to build a new house for the couple.
"Oh, you're the boy who saved me from the fire. It's nice to meet you. I'm Count Grey."
You explain that you have promised to build a new house for the couple. Count Grey understands.
you remember there was another fire, but don't remember saving the Count.
"Count Grey, there was another fire but I can't remember what happened." You say.
"Oh, that's right. That was when you saved me from the fire. That was a crazy night! But anyway, do you want the job or not?" Count Grey asks.

> You accept the job.
"Sure!" You say.
"Great! The first thing I need you to do is pick up my friend, John Wilkes Booth, at the Miller Farm. He'll be waiting for you. Now go!" Count Grey says.
Count Grey goes back to his carriage and leaves.

> You go to the Miller Farm.
You walk to the Miller Farm. You don't know who John Wilkes Booth is, but you're excited to meet him.
You get to the Miller Farm and knock on the door. The door opens and there's a short, bearded man with curly black hair.

> You introduce yourself.
"Hello, I'm Daniel." You say.
"Hello, I'm John Wilkes Booth." The man says.
Booth looks familiar to you. He looks like the man who saved your life before you woke up in the mineshaft. Maybe he's an actor.

> You ask him about the Count.
"Count Grey is an old friend of my family's." John says.
You wonder why Count Grey needed you to pick up a friend, but decide not to question it.
"So where are we going?" You ask.
"We're going to the White House!" John says.
"The White House?" You ask.
"Yes! The President is in danger. We need to save him!"
"What kind of danger?"
"Oh, just the usual treason and conspiracy. Come on, we need to go!"
You follow John out to the road.

> You say "Do I need to bring a weapon?"
"No, there are soldiers all around the White House." John says.
You follow John out to the road. You walk for a few minutes in silence.
"Why were you in jail?" You ask.
"I killed the slave owner that beat my sister." John says.

> You say "I think he deserved that"
"I think he did too." You say.
You continue walking in silence until you reach a hilltop. You see the Washington D.C. skyline in the distance. There's a dirt path that leads through the fields. There's a wooden farmhouse to your right.

> You follow John.
You follow John down the dirt path.
"Do you know why the president needs saving?" You ask.
"No, I don't." John says.
You continue walking. You notice that John is dressed like a miner, and he's carrying a large jug. It looks heavy.

> You say "What do you know about the situation?"
"Nothing. I was given this jug and told to go to the White House." John says.
You wonder why anyone would give a man who just killed his slave owner a large jug and tell him to go to the White House.

> You look at the jug.
You look at the jug. It's big and heavy copper. There's a picture of a bee on one side.
"What's in the jug?" You ask.
"I don't know. It's pretty heavy though." John says.

> You say "Do you need help with that?"
"I'll be fine." John says.
You keep following John. He walks quickly, but the jug is really heavy and you're having a hard time keeping up.
"Do you need help with that?" You ask.
"I'll be fine." John says, annoyed.

> You continue walking in silence.
You continue walking down the dirt path. It's getting dark, and the only light comes from the moon and the stars.
"Do you know what kind of bees produce honey?" You ask.
"I don't know." John says.

> You say "Do you know a lot about bees?"
"I keep bees." John says.
"Do you know a lot about bees?" You ask.
"Yes." John says.
You keep following John until you reach a fork in the road. There's a wooden sign that reads "Davenport 1 Mile".

> You keep walking.
You keep walking down the road. It's dark, and you can't see anything around you. John is a few feet ahead of you, but he's moving quickly, so you can barely see him.
"Do you know what bumblebees do?" You ask.
"No."
You keep silent and after a while, you see a wooden sign that reads "Davenport 2 Miles".
"Do you know what happens when a beekeeper doesn't wear gloves?" You ask.
"No." John says.
The road curves to the left, and you see a bridge up ahead.

> You whistle a happy tune.
You begin whistling a happy tune. You walk up to the bridge, and look down at the river flowing beneath you.
"Do you know what happens when a beekeeper doesn't wear gloves?" You ask.
"No." John says, annoyed.
You look down at the river. It's flowing rapidly, and looks deep.
"Do you want to know what happens?" You ask.
"No." John says.
You open your mouth to speak, but no sound comes out.

> You laugh.
You take a deep breath, and laugh. It's a dry, humorless laugh. John looks at you, confused.
"Do you know why no one likes ogres?" You ask.
"No." John says.
"It's because they're fat, stupid, unlovable beasts." You say.
John's eyes widen, and he runs at you with a roar. You stumble backwards as he approaches.
"Do you want to know what happens when a beekeeper doesn't wear gloves?" You yell.
You grab the jug of honey with both hands and swing it into John's chest. He grunts as the jar shatters and his chest is covered in honey. He looks down at his chest, and then turns to look at you. He grabs you with one hand by the neck and the other by the waist, and lifts you over his head. You grab at his hands as you dangle over his head, a few feet off the ground.
