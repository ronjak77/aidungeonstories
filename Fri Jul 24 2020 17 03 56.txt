You are SkullCrusherxXx, a peasant living in a small village in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and nothing else. You dream of getting out of your village and having an adventure. You go to your fields and begin working. You look up and see a portal opening in the sky. A beam of yellow light comes down and fills you with excitement and awe. You are transported into another dimension!

> You look around.
You find yourself in the middle of a battlefield. On one side is an army of demons and ogres, led by a powerful-looking red dragon. They are fighting against an army of elves, led by another dragon, this one blue.

> You say "who did this to me?"
The earth shakes and a terrible, thunderous voice says "I did, mortal! I need a brave warrior to slay the blue dragon that rules this mountain. Both sides want this mountain for their own, and it is up to you to decide who wins!"

> You say "I can't take such a big burden"
"Too bad!" the voice booms, and a bright light blinds you. When you open your eyes, you find yourself with a sword in your hand and fully armored.

> You join the fight on the side of the red dragon.
You fight valiantly, slaying dozens of elves and orcs. Eventually, you clash with the blue dragon. You stab your sword at him, but he bats you away with ease. He blows a jet of flames, engulfing you in fire.

> You hide behind the red dragon.
The blue dragon spits a jet of flames at you. You manage to roll out of the way, and stab your sword into his wing. The red dragon charges the blue one, knocking him off balance, and you take the opportunity to plunge your sword into his heart. The blue dragon lets out a pained roar and falls from the sky.

> You jump off the blue dragon and do a barrel roll.
As you jump off the dragon, it flies straight into the ground. You do a front flip over a warhorse and plunge your sword into the elf riding it.
You look up and see the red dragon falling towards you.> You dodge the falling dragon.You roll to the left and the dragon hits the ground, throwing you off your feet.
You look up and see the elves celebrating and moving in to finish off the orcs. The orcs have other ideas, and begin retreating.

"You could have touched it," says Death. "It only heats up when it's touched."
"It's pretty,"
you say, and try to climb on its back to ride it.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you," says Death. "It might throw you off and trample you."

> You ask him what the skeletal horses eat.
"They don't eat. They're dead, after all. They do, however, still bite," says Death.
"Oh," you say. "I didn't know that."
"Yeah. I usually don't have the time to train living mortals on how to handle my horses,"

> You ask him if you can be his apprentice.
"I don't think that would be wise," says Death. "It'd be too easy for me to kill you if I needed to, and I'm sure you don't want that."> You offer him your firstborn if he accepts."Ha ha ha ha!" laughs Death. "That's a good one. First of all, you don't have a firstborn. Second of all, if you did, I wouldn't want it. And third of all... Did you hear a word I said?"
"Yes."You are SkullCrusherxXx, a peasant living in a small village in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and nothing else. You dream of getting out of your village and having an adventure. You go to your fields and begin working. You look up and see a portal opening in the sky. A beam of yellow light comes down and fills you with excitement and awe. You are transported into another dimension!

> You look around.
You find yourself in the middle of a battlefield. On one side is an army of demons and ogres, led by a powerful-looking red dragon. They are fighting against an army of elves, led by another dragon, this one blue.

> You say "who did this to me?"
The earth shakes and a terrible, thunderous voice says "I did, mortal! I need a brave warrior to slay the blue dragon that rules this mountain. Both sides want this mountain for their own, and it is up to you to decide who wins!"

> You say "I can't take such a big burden"
"Too bad!" the voice booms, and a bright light blinds you. When you open your eyes, you find yourself with a sword in your hand and fully armored.

> You join the fight on the side of the red dragon.
You fight valiantly, slaying dozens of elves and orcs. Eventually, you clash with the blue dragon. You stab your sword at him, but he bats you away with ease. He blows a jet of flames, engulfing you in fire.

> You hide behind the red dragon.
The blue dragon spits a jet of flames at you. You manage to roll out of the way, and stab your sword into his wing. The red dragon charges the blue one, knocking him off balance, and you take the opportunity to plunge your sword into his heart. The blue dragon lets out a pained roar and falls from the sky.

> You jump off the blue dragon and do a barrel roll.
As you jump off the dragon, it flies straight into the ground. You do a front flip over a warhorse and plunge your sword into the elf riding it.
You look up and see the red dragon falling towards you.

> You dodge the falling dragon.
You roll to the left and the dragon hits the ground, throwing you off your feet.
You look up and see the elves celebrating and moving in to finish off the orcs. The orcs have other ideas, and begin retreating. You get up and begin looting the corpses.

> You try to find something valuable.
You find a few golden coins in the elf you stabbed. You pick them up and put them in your pocket. Suddenly, a tall, skeletal figure on a black horse rides up to you. He is wearing golden armor, with a spiked helmet.

> You say "Do I know you from somewhere?"
"I'm Death. You've been chosen to die."
"Oh, great. I was hoping you were someone else."
"You can choose how you want to die. It's your lucky day, you only have one option."

> You say "Hello"
"Hello" repeats Death, without any expression on his face.
"So, erm... How do I die?" you ask.
"I haven't decided yet. I'll be sure to send you a postcard when I figure it out," replies Death.

> You say "What if I don't want to die?"
"That's impossible," says Death. "But I could spare you if you step into my black carriage over there."
You look to where Death is pointing and you see a black carriage, with the horses being skeletal versions of ones you've seen before.

> You go and pet a skeletal horse.
You walk up to the skeletal horse, and it begins to glow red. You pull your hand back when you realize it's hot.
"You could have touched it," says Death. "It only heats up when it's touched."
"It's pretty,"
you say, and try to climb on its back to ride it.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you," says Death. "It might throw you off and trample you."

> You ask him what the skeletal horses eat.
"They don't eat. They're dead, after all. They do, however, still bite," says Death.
"Oh," you say. "I didn't know that."
"Yeah. I usually don't have the time to train living mortals on how to handle my horses,"

> You ask him if you can be his apprentice.
"I don't think that would be wise," says Death. "It'd be too easy for me to kill you if I needed to, and I'm sure you don't want that."

> You offer him your firstborn if he accepts.
"Ha ha ha ha!" laughs Death. "That's a good one. First of all, you don't have a firstborn. Second of all, if you did, I wouldn't want it. And third of all... Did you hear a word I said?"
"Yes."> You ask him if you can offer anything else."Nothing else," says Death.
You begin to panic and struggle for words. You manage to squeak out one more offer.
"Well... Can I at least get your phone number?"
Death sighs and looks at you with pity in his eyes.
