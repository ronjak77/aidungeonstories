You are Mike, a survivor trying to survive in a world filled with infected zombies everywhere. You have a pistol and a backpack. You have managed to survive several months avoiding zombies and scavenging food. You cautiously enter a rundown store and hear a noise.
You see a strange zombie with extra flesh hanging off its bones and green skin. You've never seen one like this before.

You aim your gun at the zombie, but it's not moving. You slowly walk towards it, but it still doesn't move...

> You investigate the zombie.
The zombie jumps at you and bites your arm! You pull your arm away but it tears a chunk of flesh out!
"It's an evolved zombie!" you think as you kick the zombie away. It's incredibly fast. You shoot it several times and it still won't die.

> You yell for help.
You see an old house that you have never seen before. It looks like it's been abandoned for a long time.
Your friends are fighting the evolved zombies, but they can't last much longer.
You have to decide whether to go inside the house or help your friends.

> You go help your friends.
You shoot a zombie in the head and it falls to the ground. You feel a pain in your chest and fall to the ground as well. You look at your friends and see that they are all dead too. The evolved zombies have killed them all.
Suddenly someone appears and kills the evolved zombies with ease. You try to get up but can't.
"You shouldn't be alive," you hear a voice say, "but I can save you."
A person in a hooded cloak appears in front of you.

> You say "Who are you"
"You may call me the Caretaker," the man says, "I have been chosen to care for this dimension by my master, "The Apocalypse."
"What do you want with me?"
"I have come to offer you a place by my side, in saving this world.

> You say "Why me?"
"You have great skill in combat," the Caretaker says, "combined with my own abilities, we could conquer the multiverse!"
"I'm not much for diplomacy... or talking for that matter.> You say "But I can try?""I can offer you riches, women, power, whatever you want!"
"I'll think about it."
The Caretaker seems upset but nods his head. He reaches his hand into a bag and throws a green glowing ball at you.You are Mike, a survivor trying to survive in a world filled with infected zombies everywhere. You have a pistol and a backpack.

"Vampires don't exist," he says, "I've read all the books."> You turn into a bat.You try to turn into a bat but find that you can't. The Caretaker stares at you.
"I'm sorry," he says, "I don't think you're a vampire."
The Caretaker walks away from you.You are Mike, a survivor trying to survive in a world filled with infected zombies everywhere. You have a pistol and a backpack. You have managed to survive several months avoiding zombies and scavenging food. You cautiously enter a rundown store and hear a noise.
You see a strange zombie with extra flesh hanging off its bones and green skin. You've never seen one like this before.

You aim your gun at the zombie, but it's not moving. You slowly walk towards it, but it still doesn't move...

> You investigate the zombie.
The zombie jumps at you and bites your arm! You pull your arm away but it tears a chunk of flesh out!
"It's an evolved zombie!" you think as you kick the zombie away. It's incredibly fast. You shoot it several times and it still won't die.

> You yell for help.
You see an old house that you have never seen before. It looks like it's been abandoned for a long time.
Your friends are fighting the evolved zombies, but they can't last much longer.
You have to decide whether to go inside the house or help your friends.

> You go help your friends.
You shoot a zombie in the head and it falls to the ground. You feel a pain in your chest and fall to the ground as well. You look at your friends and see that they are all dead too. The evolved zombies have killed them all.
Suddenly someone appears and kills the evolved zombies with ease. You try to get up but can't.
"You shouldn't be alive," you hear a voice say, "but I can save you."
A person in a hooded cloak appears in front of you.

> You say "Who are you"
"You may call me the Caretaker," the man says, "I have been chosen to care for this dimension by my master, "The Apocalypse."
"What do you want with me?"
"I have come to offer you a place by my side, in saving this world.

> You say "Why me?"
"You have great skill in combat," the Caretaker says, "combined with my own abilities, we could conquer the multiverse!"
"I'm not much for diplomacy... or talking for that matter.

> You say "But I can try?"
"I can offer you riches, women, power, whatever you want!"
"I'll think about it."
The Caretaker seems upset but nods his head. He reaches his hand into a bag and throws a green glowing ball at you.

> You catch the ball.
The ball explodes! You are killed instantly.

> You attack the Caretaker with your ghost arms.
You punch the Caretaker several times but it has no effect. The Caretaker looks down and sees your hands then looks up at you.
"How are you doing that?"
The Caretaker is now interested in you. You can feel his interest, he wants you to join him.

> You haunt him.
You refuse to help the Caretaker and curse at him. He seems surprised but just shakes his head.
"You could have been a great asset to me."
The Caretaker walks away from you. You try to follow him, but you find that you can't leave the city.

> You try to resurrect yourself again, this time with more effort.
You concentrate and try to raise yourself, but you find that the necromantic energy that was keeping you alive has disappeared. You try to breath but nothing happens.
You are dead.

> You cry so loud that the Caretaker comes back.
The Caretaker runs back to you and picks you up.
"It's OK, it's OK," he says, "I'll revive you."
The Caretaker kisses you on the lips and blows air into your mouth.

> You run away as fast as you can.
You try to run away, but your dead legs won't respond. The Caretaker breathes into your lungs and you cough up blood. You can't escape.
The Caretaker wraps his tongue around yours and begins to transfer energy into you.

> You transfer dead energy to him.
You begin to send necromantic energy into the Caretaker. The Caretaker seems confused and stops breathing into your mouth.
"I don't understand," he says, "I thought you were dead."
"Maybe I was never alive,"

> You wiggle your eyebrows up and down and wink at him with a smirk.
The Caretaker looks at you in confusion.
"Maybe I'm a vampire."
The Caretaker shakes his head.
"Vampires don't exist," he says, "I've read all the books."

You feel a wave of strange energy. The vampiric transformation is starting! You're going to be undead! You feel the changes beginning to take place. Your internal organs are starting to shut down. This is great!

TEST
The Caretaker is bewildered. You try to communicate, but nothing happens. The world is growing dark.You are Mike, a survivor trying to survive in a world filled with infected zombies everywhere. You have a pistol and a backpack. You have managed to survive several months avoiding zombies and scavenging food. You cautiously enter a rundown store and hear a noise.
You see a strange zombie with extra flesh hanging off its bones and green skin. You've never seen one like this before.

You aim your gun at the zombie, but it's not moving. You slowly walk towards it, but it still doesn't move...

> You investigate the zombie.
The zombie jumps at you and bites your arm! You pull your arm away but it tears a chunk of flesh out!
"It's an evolved zombie!" you think as you kick the zombie away. It's incredibly fast. You shoot it several times and it still won't die.

> You yell for help.
You see an old house that you have never seen before. It looks like it's been abandoned for a long time.
Your friends are fighting the evolved zombies, but they can't last much longer.
You have to decide whether to go inside the house or help your friends.

> You go help your friends.
You shoot a zombie in the head and it falls to the ground. You feel a pain in your chest and fall to the ground as well. You look at your friends and see that they are all dead too. The evolved zombies have killed them all.
Suddenly someone appears and kills the evolved zombies with ease. You try to get up but can't.
"You shouldn't be alive," you hear a voice say, "but I can save you."
A person in a hooded cloak appears in front of you.

> You say "Who are you"
"You may call me the Caretaker," the man says, "I have been chosen to care for this dimension by my master, "The Apocalypse."
"What do you want with me?"
"I have come to offer you a place by my side, in saving this world.

> You say "Why me?"
"You have great skill in combat," the Caretaker says, "combined with my own abilities, we could conquer the multiverse!"
"I'm not much for diplomacy... or talking for that matter.

> You say "But I can try?"
"I can offer you riches, women, power, whatever you want!"
"I'll think about it."
The Caretaker seems upset but nods his head. He reaches his hand into a bag and throws a green glowing ball at you.

> You catch the ball.
The ball explodes! You are killed instantly.

> You attack the Caretaker with your ghost arms.
You punch the Caretaker several times but it has no effect. The Caretaker looks down and sees your hands then looks up at you.
"How are you doing that?"
The Caretaker is now interested in you. You can feel his interest, he wants you to join him.

> You haunt him.
You refuse to help the Caretaker and curse at him. He seems surprised but just shakes his head.
"You could have been a great asset to me."
The Caretaker walks away from you. You try to follow him, but you find that you can't leave the city.

> You try to resurrect yourself again, this time with more effort.
You concentrate and try to raise yourself, but you find that the necromantic energy that was keeping you alive has disappeared. You try to breath but nothing happens.
You are dead.

> You cry so loud that the Caretaker comes back.
The Caretaker runs back to you and picks you up.
"It's OK, it's OK," he says, "I'll revive you."
The Caretaker kisses you on the lips and blows air into your mouth.

> You run away as fast as you can.
You try to run away, but your dead legs won't respond. The Caretaker breathes into your lungs and you cough up blood. You can't escape.
The Caretaker wraps his tongue around yours and begins to transfer energy into you.

> You transfer dead energy to him.
You begin to send necromantic energy into the Caretaker. The Caretaker seems confused and stops breathing into your mouth.
"I don't understand," he says, "I thought you were dead."
"Maybe I was never alive,"

> You wiggle your eyebrows up and down and wink at him with a smirk.
The Caretaker looks at you in confusion.
"Maybe I'm a vampire."
The Caretaker shakes his head.
"Vampires don't exist," he says, "I've read all the books."

> You turn into a bat.
You try to turn into a bat but find that you can't. The Caretaker stares at you.

"I'm sorry," he says, "I don't think you're a vampire."

You feel a wave of strange energy. The vampiric transformation is starting! You're going to be undead! You feel the changes beginning to take place. Your internal organs are starting to shut down. This is great!
The Caretaker comes back with a small black book in his hands. He takes your hand and opens the book.

> You say "You believe me now? You don't think I'm a vampire? Ha! You fool..."
"I'm so sorry," the Caretaker says, "I wish I had known. I could have helped you."
